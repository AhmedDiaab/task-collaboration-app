Task: Real-Time Collaboration Board with Node.js and Socket.io

Requirements:
1. Develop a real-time collaboration board using Node.js and Socket.io.
2. Allow multiple users to join the collaboration board and see each other's updates in real time.
3. Implement drawing and text input functionalities on the board, enabling users to create and edit content collaboratively.
4. Support different drawing tools (e.g., pen, brush, shapes) with customizable colors and sizes.
5. Implement an undo/redo feature to revert or replay board changes.
6. Provide a chat functionality for users to communicate with each other while collaborating.
7. Support saving and loading board states to allow users to continue their work at a later time.
8. Implement user authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the collaboration board.
9. Store board data in a database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to persist the board state.
10. Implement error handling and logging for the application.
11. Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and correctness of the collaboration board.
12. Use a modern front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) for the client-side of the application.
13. Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
14. Deploy the collaboration board application to a hosting platform or cloud service of your choice (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure).

Details:
1. Set up a new Node.js project with a suitable name.
2. Install the necessary dependencies, including Socket.io and any front-end framework dependencies.
3. Create an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests.
4. Implement WebSocket functionality using Socket.io to enable real-time communication between the server and clients.
5. Develop the collaboration board interface using the chosen front-end framework, allowing users to draw, add text, and interact with the board.
6. Implement drawing and text input functionalities on the board using appropriate libraries or custom logic.
7. Set up a database connection and define appropriate schemas or tables to store the board state and user information.
8. Implement user authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, session-based) to authenticate and authorize users.
9. Store and retrieve board data from the database, including the current state and user actions.
10. Implement an undo/redo feature to allow users to revert or replay board changes.
11. Implement a chat functionality using Socket.io to enable real-time communication between users.
12. Handle and display errors appropriately in the client-side application.
13. Write unit tests using a suitable testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to verify the functionality of the collaboration board.
14. Set up error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and handle any unhandled exceptions.
15. Optimize the application for responsiveness and ensure it works well on different devices and screen sizes.
16. Deploy the collaboration board application to a hosting platform or cloud service, making it accessible online.

Note: This task assumes you have experience with web development, including knowledge of front-end frameworks, WebSocket technology, and database integration.
